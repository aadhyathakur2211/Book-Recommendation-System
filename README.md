## User's manual

The demo of our program is hosted on the following website for the next 1 month for your reference:  **http://20.127.108.112:8501/**<br/>
You can use the sidebar on the left side to select a user profile and a mood.<br/>
In the middle of the screen, you will see what a user has read and what the suggestions are before reranking and after reranking. Images and information of books are provided by the dataset while some images are missing.<br/>

The overall objective of the project is to build a book recommender system using PrefixSpan andassociation rule mining by taking usersâ€™ moods and past preferences into account through an interface.<br/>
